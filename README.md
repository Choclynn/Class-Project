# Biking Jacket

As the above title suggests this project is a jacket that is meant
to be worn when going out for a bike ride. This bike will provide
the wearer four basic functions. A turn left signal, a turn right
signal, brake lights, and finally a night time visability mode.
This particular project is controlled by an Ardunio Uno.

# Project Picture
A picture of the project will eventually end up here!!

# List of Materials
The materials I ended up using include:
* Ardunio Uno
* external arduino battery pack
* five AA batteries
* zip-up hoodie
* one spool of conductive thread (3ply)
* Three resistors (10,000ohm)
* pair of scissors
* various needles
* sewable LEDs (3 colours)
* electrical tape
* three basic push buttons
* wires to connect to Arduino 

# The Build
Technically this build is actually fairly simple. It is just an assortment
of LEDs and a few buttons. On a breadboard or something of the like it is
super simple. Putting this onto the jacket however provides one with a much
more difficult task as grounding becomes a much harder task just as an example. I recommend that 
some planning occur before actually sewing stuff to the jacket. I will provide
a simple picture showing how to set up an LED and a push button but won't
give a view of the jacket as it rather messy and I can't draw very well.
I will however give a picture showing which of my LEDs are linked together to
give one and idea of how wiring may work.
