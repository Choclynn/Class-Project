# Biking Jacket

As the above title suggests this project is a jacket that is meant
to be worn when going out for a bike ride. This bike will provide
the wearer four basic functions. A turn left signal, a turn right
signal, brake lights, and finally a night time visability mode.
This particular project is controlled by an Ardunio Uno.

A picture of the project will eventually end up here!!
